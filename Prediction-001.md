### Prediction One

The Corona Virus outbreak in China will be out of control by 2020-02-28. The sign is that Beijing and Shanghai will be 'sealed'.

Probability: 90%

### Reasoning

1. The Corona Virus is a novel virus, never seen before by humans and the medical community. Whether it was human-engineered or it came from bats will be known in the near term. White House has ordered an investigation on the origin of the virus. I give it a higher probability that it was a man-made virus. If it was from bats, CCP would have banned all wild life tradings in public markets by now and forever. 
2. The virus is deadly and highly contagious. The official death rate is only 3.1%, which is obviously a lie. The real death rate could be much higher than 10%. Dr. Li Wen-Liang, the first whistle blower, just died on 2020-02-06. He is only 34 years old. He is a doctor. If he cannot avoid being infected, ordinary people have no chance of avoiding the infection either. Furthermore, there are no signs of infection during the first phase when people become infected. That suggests the virus can easily spread.
