### Prediction Two

Xi will be replaced by his opponents by 2020-07-01.

Probability: 50%.

### Reasoning

1. Xi must have many opponents, who are looking for opportunities to strike. Xi mis-handled this virus outbreak to the extreme. Now, more and more people understand that the CCP totalitarian system is the root of all evil. The opponents may have a window of opportunities here.

2. Under the current CCP rule, everybody in the upper echelon fears their fate. The only chance for them to safely escape is when CCP collapses. Until CCP colapses, these CCP officials have nowhere to go. In reality, they all wish the collapse can come soon. Since all of them have foreign passports, they can all flee and enjoy the legal services and protections offered by democratic societies, where they will remain with their enormously large assets stolen from China.
